# About Thunderbird

## I Want to Start Hacking

This page has some information on where to get information and get plugged into the Community. If you are ready to start hacking, head to the ["Getting Started"](the-basics/untitled.md) page.

## Getting Plugged into the Community

We have a complete listing of the ways in which you can get involved with Thunderbird [on our website](https://thunderbird.net/get-involved). Below are some quick references from that page that you can use if you are looking to contribute to Thunderbird core right away.

### Mailing Lists

If you want to participate in discussions about Thunderbird development, there are two main mailing lists you want to join.

1. \*\*\*\*[**TB-Planning**](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/tb-planning)**:** This mailing list is higher level topics like: the future of Thunderbird, potential features, and changes that you would like to see happen. It is also used to discuss a variety of broader issues around community and governance of the project.
2. \*\*\*\*[**Maildev**](http://lists.thunderbird.net/mailman/listinfo/maildev_lists.thunderbird.net)**:** A moderated mailing list for discussing engineering plans for Thunderbird. It is a place where you can raise questions and ideas for core Thunderbird development.

### IRC

If you want to ask questions about how to hack on Thunderbird, the IRC channel you want to join is [\#maildev on irc.mozilla.org](irc://irc.mozilla.org/maildev).
