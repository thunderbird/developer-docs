# Update for Thunderbird 78

Support for legacy extensions was removed from Thunderbird Beta version 74, released in February 2020. Therefore, only modern MailExtensions are compatible with Thunderbird 78. This guide is intended to help developers to port their Legacy WebExtensions to MailExtensions.

{% hint style="info" %} We do not suggest to convert older Legacy Bootstrapped Extensions or Legacy Overlay Extensions (as used in Thunderbird 60) directly to MailExtensions. They should first be converted to Legacy WebExtensions as described in the [update guide for Thunderbird 68](https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/updating/tb68). {% endhint %}

If you need any help, get in touch with the [add-on developer community](https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/community).


## Dropping the legacy key and adding new entry points

The technical conversion from a Legacy WebExtension to a MailExtension is simple: drop the `legacy` key from the `manifest.json` file.

Now your add-on should install in current versions of Thunderbird without issues, but it will do nothing. You need to define one or more entry points as documented in the [WebExtensions course on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension), but for a MailExtension the most common option will be adding a *background script* to `manifest.json`:

```json
"background": {
  "scripts": ["background-script.js"]
}
```

Adding this section to your `manifest.json` will cause the file `background-script.js` to be loaded and evaluated by Thunderbird. For bootstrap typed Legacy WebExtensions, the existing `bootstrap.js` script itself is a good starting point for a background script â€“ for overlay typed Legacy WebExtensions it may be reasonable to start with an empty script and convert overlays using the guidelines below, gradually building up the background script.

Contrary to the bootstrap script in legacy add-ons, the background scripts will *not* get evaluated in a privileged browser context. Instead it is added to an HTML document (a.k.a the "background page") living in a content process, which only has access to [MailExtension APIs](https://thunderbird-webextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and some WebExtension APIs inherited from the underlying Firefox code base (they are listed further down on [this page](https://thunderbird-webextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). Any interaction with Thunderbird must occur through these APIs. Whenever code needs to be added to the background script, you need to make sure to migrate calls to XPCOM or other native Thunderbird features to these APIs.

{% hint style="info" %} Since the WebExtension technology originates in Browsers like Google Chrome and Firefox, the namespace for this new kind of API is `chrome.*` or `browser.*` which work in Thunderbird as well. Thunderbird also supports `messenger.*`, which is a better fit for MailExtensions. {% endhint %}



## Experiment-ing with new APIs

While the Thunderbird team plans to add more APIs with upcoming releases, the current set of APIs will not be sufficient to port most add-ons. To work around this limitation, add-ons can introduce their own, additional APIs as so-called [*experiments*](https://thunderbird-webextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/experiments.html).

{% hint style="info" %} Any feature that was available in previous versions of Thunderbird remains available in Thunderbird 78 inside of experimental APIs. {% endhint %}

As experiments usually run in the main process and have unrestricted access to any aspect of Thunderbird, they are expected to require updates for each new version of Thunderbird. To reduce the maintenance burden in the future, it is in your own interest to use experimental APIs only to the extent necessary for the add-on.

Best practice: Try to write APIs that would be useful for a wide range of add-ons, not just the one you're porting. That way, you can later on propose the API you designed for inclusion in Thunderbird, with your add-on serving as reference implementation. If your APIs become a part of Thunderbird, you no longer need to maintain them as part of the add-on.

A more thorough description of experimental APIs can be found in a [separate article](experiments.md).


## Replacing options

Option windows are replaced by [settings pages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Implement_a_settings_page) defined in `manifest.json`:

```json
"options_ui": {
  "page": "options.html"
}
```

Instead of a XUL dialog, the specified HTML document is used, which will be accessible to the user through the add-on manager. From that document, all WebExtension and MailExtension APIs can be accessed in the same way as from the background script. The settings themselves should be stored using one of the new APIs to store data, such as [`storage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage), so it may be necessary to add an experiment to migrate existing settings from nsIPrefBranch or other mechanisms not accessible through modern APIs. The [legacyPrefMigration example add-on](https://github.com/thundernest/sample-extensions/tree/master/legacyPrefMigration) includes such a migration API.

## Replacing chrome.manifest

The `chrome.manifest` file is no longer supported. Many mechanisms have a more or less direct equivalent in the WebExtension world:
* **interfaces** it should no longer be necessary to use binary interfaces, as binary components are deprecated for a long time. To access custom methods on JS-implemented classes from an experiment, use `.wrappedJSObject` to get access to the raw JS implementation.
* **component**, **contract** [see section 'Replacing XPCOM registration' below](#replacing-xpcom-registration).
* **category** use [`nsICategoryManager`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/nsICategoryManager) through an experiment
* **content**, **skin**, **resource** it is no longer easily possible to assign chrome://- and resource://-URLs from add-ons. However, all files of an add-on are now available through moz-extension:// URLs by default. To generate such URLs, use [`messenger.runtime.getURL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime/getURL). Some WebExtension APIs also accept relative paths and generate suitable URLs automatically.
* **locale** localization for WebExtensions is handled using the [`i18n` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n), which uses a single `messages.json` file to store translations.
* **style** use an experiment to monitor open windows, and inject the style through that experiment
* **overlay** [see section 'Replacing Overlays' below](#replacing-overlays).

There are no direct equivalents to manifest flags, so add-ons now need to provide their own mechanisms to switch code or resources depending on the runtime environment. Relevant information is accessible through the [`runtime` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime/).

## Converting locale files

*todo*


## Replacing Overlays

XUL overlays are no longer supported and you need to find an alternative:
* For overlays loading a script without user interface relationship: Move the script's content to a background script (Example: startup script in a main window overlay)
* For overlays extending the user interface in a way that can be replaced using calls to built-in APIs: Do those calls in a background script (Example: adding context menu items)
* For overlays extending the user interface beyond the built-in APIs: Add an experimental API with a window listener and manually add the needed UI elements (Example: [experimental restart API](https://github.com/thundernest/sample-extensions/blob/master/restart/implementation.js)). Try to make your API as generic as possible, so it could become an official MailExtension API.

## Replacing XUL windows and dialogs

While it would be possible to attempt to re-use existing XUL code in an experiment, it is probably a better idea to use the more future-proof [`windows` MailExtension API](https://thunderbird-webextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/windows.html) to create a window displaying an HTML dialog:

```javascript
messenger.windows.create({
    height: 400,
    width: 500,
    url: "/path/from/root/of/addon/to/dialog.html",
    type: "popup"
});
```

From these dialogs, all WebExtension and MailExtension APIs can be accessed in the same way as from a background script. To send data to and from the opened window, you can use the message passing concept. An example can be found in [this TopicBox thread](https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/groups/addons/Ta8337b5f8c8012d5/webextension-how-to-send-data-to-created-window-and-back-as-with-legacy-window-open).

## Replacing XPCOM registration

Components and contract IDs can get registered by calling [`Components.manager.registerFactory()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsIComponentRegistrar#registerFactory()) from an experiment. Remember to also call [`Components.manager.unregisterFactory()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsIComponentRegistrar#unregisterFactory()) when the experiment shuts down.

To get a factory implementation, copy the component's existing implementation into an experiment's implementation script and use its NSGetFactory method to build a factory to register:

```javascript
// original chrome.manifest:
component {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000} implementation.js
contract  @example.com/contract;1 {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}

// original implementation.js:
var { XPCOMUtils } = ChromeUtils.import("resource://gre/modules/XPCOMUtils.jsm");
let classID = Components.ID("{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}");
let contractID = "@example.com/contract;1";
function exampleComponent() { /* ... implementation ... */ }
exampleComponent.prototype = { /* ... implementation ... */ };
var NSGetFactory = XPCOMUtils.generateNSGetFactory([exampleComponent]);

// new experiment.js:
/* ... */ getAPI(context) { /* ... */
  var { XPCOMUtils } = ChromeUtils.import("resource://gre/modules/XPCOMUtils.jsm");
  let classID = Components.ID("{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}");
  let contractID = "@example.com/contract;1";
  function exampleComponent() { /* ... implementation ... */ }
  exampleComponent.prototype = { /* ... implementation ... */ };
  let factory = XPCOMUtils.generateNSGetFactory([exampleComponent])(classId);
  Components.manager.registerFactory(classID, "exampleComponent", contractID, factory);
  context.callOnClose({close(){
    Components.manager.unregisterFactory(classID, factory);
  }});
/* ... */ } /* ... */
```

For complex cases, it might be reasonable to put the implementation and optionally its registration in a separate JavaScript module.


## Replacing various discontinued features within experiment code

Many parts of XUL are discontinued, and there are some other changes that prevent legacy code to run unchanged in an experiment. [A separate article deals with these changes.](changes.md)


## Additional Tips

Some general tips to speed up your porting workflow:
* To debug code running in the background page or to interactively use Web-/MailExtension APIs, you can access debugging tools using the gear icon in the add-on tab.
* To debug code running in the browser context (usually: your experiments) you can still use the browser console (Ctrl+Shift+J) or developer toolbox (Ctrl+Shift+I) â€“ just like with legacy add-ons.
* The add-on debugging tools accessible through the add-on page's gear icon permit to directly install add-ons without packaging them, similar to linking a legacy add-on in the profile folder. Using that option permits to reload the add-on without restarting Thunderbird.
* When testing a change in an experiment, always restart Thunderbird *and delete Thunderbird's cache folder*. Experiment code may get cached, and these caches are not always cleared when uninstalling or replacing an add-on.
