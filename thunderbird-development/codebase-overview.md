# Codebase Overview

## Overview of Comm Central

The following directories are included in the comm-central repository:

**build**  
Miscellaneous files used by the build process.

**calendar**  
Source code of the Lightning extension and Google Calendar Provider extension.

**chat**  
Files for the chat component of Thunderbird. There is also related code in `mail/components/im`.

The subdirectories are:

* **components** Various chat features, includes the interfaces that each protocol must implement.
* **content** User interface files which become `chrome://chat/content/…`.
* **locales** The user-visible strings, in US English. Files from this directory become `chrome://chat/locale/…`.
* **modules** JavaScript modules that are specific to chat.
* **protocols** Various protocol implementations. Each of subdirectory implements a protocol to the interfaces found under **components**.
* **themes** Common and platform-specific styling specific to chat. Files from this directory become `chrome://chat/skin/…`.

**common**

**editor**  
UI for the Compose window and the Composer part of SeaMonkey. Not used in Thunderbird.

**ldap**  
The LDAP C SDK. Used for communicating with LDAP servers.

**mail**  
Thunderbird specific source code. It's no coincidence that this folder is laid out a lot like the `browser` and `toolkit` directories on mozilla-central. Many of the subdirectories follow the same pattern:

* **content** User interface files which become `chrome://messenger/content/…`.
* **modules** Javascript modules which become `resource:///modules/…`.
* **test** Mochitest and/or XPCShell tests.

The subdirectories are:

* **app** Configuration and packaging instructions. Contains `all-thunderbird.js`, the default preferences.

* **branding** Icons and imagery.
* **components** Various Thunderbird features, including:
  * **accountcreation** The account setup wizard.
